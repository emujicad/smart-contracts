# Project Context

This project demonstrates the use of interfaces in Solidity. It includes a `Counter` contract, an `ICounter` interface, and a `CallInterface` contract that interacts with the `Counter` contract through the interface.

## Key Learnings

- How to define and use interfaces in Solidity.
- How to interact with a contract through its interface.
- The concept of separation of concerns in smart contract development.
